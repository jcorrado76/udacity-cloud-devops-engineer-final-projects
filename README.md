## Cloud DevOps Capstone Project
In this project, we'll develop a web application that will be deployed onto a kubernetes cluster of our choosing, and integrated with a CI/CD server.
Finally, we'll make use of docker format containers by uploading our images to DockerHub.

The web app for this project so far is just a simple toy dash plotly dashboard.
